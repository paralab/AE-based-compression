# SWAE 3D Numerical Stability Fixes

## Problem Identified
The initial SWAE 3D training was experiencing **NaN (Not a Number) losses** from the very first batch, indicating severe numerical instability issues.

## Root Causes and Solutions

### 1. GDN Layer Instability
**Problem**: The Generalized Divisive Normalization (GDN) layer from the paper was causing numerical instability due to:
- Division by zero or near-zero values
- Negative values under square root operations
- Unstable gradient flow

**Solution**: Replaced GDN/iGDN with standard BatchNorm3D + ReLU
```python
# Before (unstable):
self.gdn = GDN(out_channels)

# After (stable):
self.bn = nn.BatchNorm3d(out_channels)
self.relu = nn.ReLU(inplace=True)
```

### 2. Learning Rate Too High
**Problem**: Initial learning rate of 1e-3 was too aggressive for the SWAE architecture.

**Solution**: Reduced learning rate to 1e-4
```python
# Before:
--lr 1e-3

# After:
--lr 1e-4
```

### 3. Regularization Weight Too High
**Problem**: Sliced-Wasserstein regularization weight (λ) of 10.0 was dominating the loss.

**Solution**: Reduced λ to 1.0
```python
# Before:
--lambda-reg 10.0

# After:
--lambda-reg 1.0
```

### 4. Batch Size Too Large
**Problem**: Large batch size (32) was causing memory pressure and unstable gradients.

**Solution**: Reduced batch size to 16
```python
# Before:
--batch-size 32

# After:
--batch-size 16
```

### 5. Missing Gradient Clipping
**Problem**: Exploding gradients were causing parameter updates to become unstable.

**Solution**: Added gradient clipping
```python
# Added after loss.backward():
torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)
```

### 6. Tensorboard Dependency Issue
**Problem**: Missing tensorboard package was causing import errors.

**Solution**: Made tensorboard optional
```python
try:
    from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter
    TENSORBOARD_AVAILABLE = True
except ImportError:
    print("Warning: tensorboard not available, logging will be disabled")
    TENSORBOARD_AVAILABLE = False
    SummaryWriter = None
```

## Current Training Configuration

### Model Architecture (Stable Version)
```python
# Encoder: 1 → 32 → 64 → 128 → 16 (latent)
# Decoder: 16 → 128 → 64 → 32 → 1
# Block size: 8×8×8
# Compression ratio: 32:1 (2048 bytes → 64 bytes)
```

### Training Parameters
```bash
--k-values 2 3 4 5 6       # Mathematical function frequencies
--resolution 40            # 40×40×40 input resolution  
--block-size 8            # 8×8×8 blocks (125 per sample)
--latent-dim 16           # 16-dimensional latent space
--lambda-reg 1.0          # Reduced SW regularization
--batch-size 16           # Smaller batch size
--epochs 200              # Training epochs
--lr 1e-4                 # Lower learning rate
--train-split 0.8         # 80% train, 20% validation
```

### Dataset Configuration
```python
# Total samples: 500 functions
# K combinations: [(2,2,2), (3,3,3), (4,4,4), (5,5,5), (6,6,6)]
# Blocks per sample: 5³ = 125
# Total training blocks: 400 samples × 125 = 50,000
# Total validation blocks: 100 samples × 125 = 12,500
```

## Expected Results
With these stability fixes:
- **Loss values**: Should remain finite and decrease over time
- **PSNR**: Expected 30-60 dB range (good for scientific data)
- **Training time**: ~12-24 hours for 200 epochs on A100 GPU
- **Memory usage**: Reduced due to smaller batch size and simpler normalization

## Job Status
- **Job ID**: 10760648
- **Status**: Queued on gpuA100x4 partition
- **Account**: bcqs-delta-gpu
- **Expected start**: When GPU resources become available

## Verification
Local testing confirmed:
- ✅ No NaN losses (values like 6.789584, 9.913219)
- ✅ Finite gradient norms (102.114484)
- ✅ Proper tensor shapes and data flow
- ✅ Successful forward/backward passes

The implementation now follows a more conservative approach while maintaining the core SWAE principles from the paper, prioritizing numerical stability over exact paper replication.
